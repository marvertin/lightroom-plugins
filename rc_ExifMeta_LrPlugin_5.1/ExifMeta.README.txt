First-time Installation & Configuration
=======================================

*** See below for subsequent installations / updating.

-  Unzip the downloaded plugin into any user data folder you like (e.g. Desktop or Documents, do not put in
   "Program Files" folder or in with operating system files...), and remember its location for step 4.
-  Open Lightroom's Plugin Manager (on the File Menu).
-  Click the 'Add' Button (lower left).
-  Select the folder whose name ends with '.lrplugin' (including the dot, but not the apostrophes),

   *** Mac users: the correct folder to select may appear as a "plugin", instead of a folder proper.

-  Review the information presented by the plugin manager, and edit settings if necessary or desirable.
-  Click 'Done'.
